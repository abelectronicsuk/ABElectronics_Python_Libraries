AB Electronics UK IO Pi | - Tutorial 3

Requires python smbus to be installed
For Python 2 install with: sudo apt-get install python-smbus
For Python 3 install with: sudo apt-get install python3-smbus

run with: python tutorial3.py
================================================

This tutorial shows how to use interrupts on the IO Pi Plus.
Port 0 on Bus 1 is set as inputs with pull-ups enabled and the pins inverted.
Port 0 on Bus 2 is set as outputs.
When a button is pressed on port 0 on bus 1 an interrupt is triggered.
The interrupt value is read and the value is used to set the output bus 2.
