AB Electronics UK IO Pi Python Library
=====

Python Library to use with IO Pi Raspberry Pi expansion board from https://www.abelectronics.co.uk

The example python files can be found in /ABElectronics_Python_Libraries/IOPi/demos  

**Note:** Microchip recommends that pin 8 (GPA7) and pin 16 (GPB7) are used as outputs only.  This change was made for revision D MCP23017 chips manufactured after June 2020. See the [MCP23017 datasheet](https://www.abelectronics.co.uk/docs/pdf/microchip-mcp23017.pdf) for more information.

### Downloading and Installing the library

To download to your Raspberry Pi type in the terminal: 

```
git clone https://github.com/abelectronicsuk/ABElectronics_Python_Libraries.git
```

To install the python library navigate into the ABElectronics_Python_Libraries folder and run:  

For Python 2.7:
```
sudo python setup.py install
```
For Python 3.5:
```
sudo python3 setup.py install
```

If you have PIP installed you can install the library directly from GitHub with the following command:

For Python 2.7:
```
sudo python2.7 -m pip install git+https://github.com/abelectronicsuk/ABElectronics_Python_Libraries.git
```

For Python 3.5:
```
sudo python3.5 -m pip install git+https://github.com/abelectronicsuk/ABElectronics_Python_Libraries.git
```

The IO Pi library is located in the IOPi directory

The library requires smbus2 or python-smbus to be installed.  

For Python 2.7:
```
sudo pip install smbus2
```
For Python 3.5:
```
sudo pip3 install smbus2
```

Classes:
----------  
```
IOPi(address, initialise, bus)
```
**Parameters:**  
address: i2c address for the target device. 0x20 to 0x27

Usage
====
To use the IO Pi library in your code you must first import the library:
```
from IOPi import IOPi
```

Next, you must initialise the IO object with the I2C address of the I/O controller chip.  The default addresses for the IO Pi are 0x20 and 0x21:

```
bus1 = IOPI(0x20)
```

We will read the inputs 1 to 8 from bus 2 so set port 0 as inputs and enable the internal pull-up resistors 

```
bus1.set_port_direction(0, 0xFF)
bus1.set_port_pullups(0, 0xFF)
```

You can now read pin 1 with:
```
print('Pin 1: ' + str(bus1.read_pin(1)))
```
