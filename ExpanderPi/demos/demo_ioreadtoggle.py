================================================
AB Electronics UK Expander Pi | Digital I/O Read Toggle Demo

Requires python smbus to be installed
For Python 2 install with: sudo apt-get install python-smbus
For Python 3 install with: sudo apt-get install python3-smbus

run with: python demo_ioreadtoggle.py
================================================

This example reads the input from pin 1 and toggles an output variable
on each button press.
The internal pull-up resistors are enabled so the input pin can be toggled
by connecting it to ground.
